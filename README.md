Write an introduction of JavaScript Data Structure stores Hash Tables & Dictionaries and explain each one of them. (Provide with your explanation pseudocodes, diagrams and executable code.

I wrote all about JS Data structures in Week-11 repository, so this week I will focus more on Hash tables

Data structures enable us to:

Manage and utilize large datasets
Search for particular data from a database
Design algorithms that are tailored towards particular programs
Handle multiple requests from users at once
Simplify and speed up data processing

JavaScript has primitive and non-primitive data structures. Primitive data structures and data types are native to the programming language. These include boolean, null, number, string, etc. Non-primitive data structures are not defined by the programming language but rather by the programmer. These include linear data structures, static data structures, and dynamic data structures, like queue and linked lists.

Arrays
Arrays are the most simple of the data structures, an array allows you to store data for later use. Arrays have a fixed number of cells, decided when creating the array, and each of these cells are given a numberic value (a number) or a numeric index to select the data).
